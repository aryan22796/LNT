defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class in Python.
 It is part of the collections module and provides a default value for a nonexistent key.
  When accessing a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary, instead of raising a KeyError, 
  a default value is provided, and the key is automatically added to the dictionary with this default value.

The defaultdict requires a factory function to specify the 
default value for nonexistent keys. This factory function is called without arguments to produce the default value.
